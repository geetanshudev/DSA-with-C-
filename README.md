![Learn DSA in C Language](https://github.com/geetanshudev/DSA-with-C-/assets/119582068/2a5fec7a-13aa-4103-87e2-d8ee5cfbe098)
<br>
This repository dives into the fundamental concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in the widely used C programming language.
It provides a platform for beginners and experienced programmers alike to explore, learn, and experiment with essential DSA building blocks.
<br>
Some of the key features are :-
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Organized Folder</strong> : I have created separate folder for different topics like Array,Linked List,Stack,Queue,etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multiple implementations</strong>: Where applicable, different approaches for solving the same problem are showcased, offering insight into trade-offs and best practices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comments in Program</strong>: In most of the codes i add comment and add explanation which helps to learn about the programs.
  </li>
</ol>
<hr>
In this repository i add different folders :-
<br>
<br>
<strong>Array</strong>: In this folder I have write basic codes of different operations like Traversing, Insert Element, Deletion of element from array and many more:-
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Finding Maximum elements from array.</li>
  <li>Searching Elements</li>
  <li>Inserting Elements with different positiion.</li>
  <li>Creation of array with Dynamic Memory Allocation using <strong>malloc function</strong></li>
  <li>Using Structures to store value in arrays.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>String</strong> : In this folder I have write a basic program of string operations like initialization,taking string data and print out the data and many more :-
<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Testing 2 different functions like scanf() printf() and gets() puts(). </li>
  <li>Conting string character without string functions.</li>
  <li>Counting alphabet ,digits and special characters.</li>
  <li>String reverse operations.</li>
  <li>String comparison (Equal or not)</li>
  <li>Convert lowercase to uppercase (without using string.h)</li>
  <li>Concatenate 2 strings (not using strcat() ).</li>
  <li>And Many More.........</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong>Linklist</strong> : In this i have covered different types of link list like <strong>Singly Link List , Doubly Link List , Circular Link list , Double Circular link list</strong> in which I have perform different types of operations like :- </br>
<ul>
  <li>Creating list,</li>
  <li>Traversing list,</li>
  <li>Inserting Element in List
  <ul>
    <li>From begining of list,</li>
    <li>From end of list,</li>
    <li>At given positions</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Deleting Element from list
  <ul>
    <li>From Begining of list,</li>
    <li>From End of list,</li>
    <li>From given positions</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Serching Element from list,</li>
  <li>Reversing Elements in list.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Future Scope :</strong> This Repository is actively maintained and welcomes contributions. I have to add more DSA topics as follows:
<ul>
  
  
  
  <li>Queue</li>
  <li>Tree</li>
  <li>BST</li>
  <li>Graph</li>
  <li>Hash</li>
  <li>And Many more ....</li>
</ul>
