<br>
This repository dives into the fundamental concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in the widely used C programming language.
It provides a platform for beginners and experienced programmers alike to explore, learn, and experiment with essential DSA building blocks.
<br>
Some of the key features are :-
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Organized Folder</strong> : I have created separate folder for different topics like Array,Linked List,Stack,Queue,etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Multiple implementations</strong>: Where applicable, different approaches for solving the same problem are showcased, offering insight into trade-offs and best practices.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comments in Program</strong>: In most of the codes i add comment and add explanation which helps to learn about the programs.
  </li>
</ol>
<hr>
In this repository i add different folders :-
<br>
<br>
<strong>Array</strong>: In this folder I have write basic codes of different operations like Traversing, Insert Element, Deletion of element from array and many more:-
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Finding Maximum elements from array.</li>
  <li>Searching Elements</li>
  <li>Inserting Elements with different positiion.</li>
  <li>Creation of array with Dynamic Memory Allocation using <strong>malloc function</strong></li>
  <li>Using Structures to store value in arrays.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<strong>Future Scope :</strong> This Repository is actively maintained and welcomes contributions. I have to add more DSA topics as follows:
<ul>
  <li> String </li>
  <li>Linked List</li>
  <li>Stack</li>
  <li>Queue</li>
  <li>Tree</li>
  <li>BST</li>
  <li>Graph</li>
  <li>Hash</li>
  <li>And Many more ....</li>
</ul>
